a simple irc bot written in the c programming language

robot3 is a simple irc bot written in the c programming language. i will be focusing on first of all just getting the bot to connect to a server and say some stuff. no fancy web apis or anything (at least not yet). the main goal of the bot is really just for the purposes of testing some new object types i've been working on in c as well as some other feautures of the preprocessor i've been playing around with. for now, don't expect to take the bot seriously or use it in your daily production. it is just a cute little hackable project. feel free to contribute.
